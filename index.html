				<p>Amateur sport teams currently do not have an organized way to connect to other amateur sports
			      teams in order to play casual games. Our solution should provide these amateur athletes a way to
				  connect with each other and compete. </p>

				<p>My team (Team Gorilla) and I worked together to create these personas. These personas are the types of people who would potentially use the app that we are creating. It includes their needs, wants, and levels of technical experience which would help us to develop an app that is not only useful, but usable for all.</p>
